                            I thought for long time until I defined my average prices as I wanted they to be cheap for the clients and optimized for me and them.
                            After I decied to be self-employed I saw how much we can save from additional taxation from the government and to be easier for them to pay me.
                            They just made a payment, I send them invoice and that's everything. I am paying my insurance, government taxes at the minimum for my country and taxes for accountant.
                            The prices are listed on the homepage and they are synchronized with the sheet that I created <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjgE1PTWX42fH4eoIMzhvRhUyyYjhJ3a50YqfbZy5dk" target="_blank">here.</a>
                            Please feel free to comment them with me and to use the average for the project you want to develop.
