                        <p class="excert">
                            How and why I choose to change my employment style and to have personal branding. Teams that I joined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I studied many years and worked hard for so long, but i always wanted more fredom and flexability, more option to choose from and more free time to get my ideas into practice.<br />
                            After 8 long years on permanent positions with average or low salary and working simutanously on 2 or 3 places i realised that the things are not happening as I wanted to happened.<br />
                            I had good knowledge, but i wanted to be better too. I tried to work as small company alone and with some friends, but it was not successful in a long term.<br />
                            After so many troubles I realised one thing: The best way of working for me is to be a CONTRACTOR. <br />
                            <br />
                            If I work as a contractor I will constantly improve myself, have more time and flexability, work hard for some period and rest for while after the end of the project. <br />
                            Also I would be free to pass my knowledge to students and to contact with more contractors as me. That's the best option, and it's good that there are such options.<br />
                            <br />
                            My company <a href="https://takerman.net" target="_blank">TAKERMAN</a> is frozen from some years and not functioning.<br />
                            I will check if I need to defreeze it or register as self employed.<br />
                            <br />
                            I am starting to change my way of thinking and to create a list with the Right things to do.<br />
                            My branding is ready and my portfolio is online. I bought a course for contractors and I am improving myself in different areas as accounting etc.<br />
                            <br />
                            Soon I will be able to show to the people how I can help them and there would be no borders to tell me that some technologies are not the right for<br />
                            that case.<br />
                            <br />
                            Follow my blog, there will be interestning posts.<br />
